[This](https://willhardison.github.io/crosswordpuzzle/) is a passion project conceptualized and developed by Justin Calser (@JustinCasler) and Will Hardison (@willhardison). WesCrossWord is a fully functioning crossword webapp that will be added to the Wesleyan Argus online newspaper during the upcoming redesign of the website.
